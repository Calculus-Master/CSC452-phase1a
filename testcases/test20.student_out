Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to PID 1.
phase2_start_service_processes() called -- currently a NOP

Phase 1A TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using spork() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Attempt to create MAXPROC+2 processes (without calling join() on any of them).  This will work many times but eventually fail because all of the procTable slots are full.  We will only print out info about the failed ones.
testcase_main(): start 52 processes
